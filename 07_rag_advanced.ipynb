If you haven't completed it yet, please do so first.\n\n---\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\nIn this notebook, you'll learn **advanced RAG techniques** beyond the basics:\n\n1. ✅ **Hybrid Search** - Combining semantic and keyword search\n2. ✅ **Query Expansion** - Generating multiple search queries\n3. ✅ **Reranking** - Improving retrieval quality with rerankers\n4. ✅ **Contextual Compression** - Extracting relevant excerpts\n5. ✅ **Multi-Query Retrieval** - Parallel searches with different perspectives\n6. ✅ **Production Optimizations** - Caching, batching, streaming\n7. ✅ **Advanced Citations** - Relevance scores and metadata tracking\n\n---\n\n## What is Advanced RAG?\n\nWhile basic RAG (from Notebook 03) works well for many use cases, production systems often need:\n\n- **Better retrieval quality**: Not all relevant documents rank highest\n- **Query understanding**: Handle complex or ambiguous questions\n- **Context optimization**: Too much context → costs, too little → poor answers\n- **Performance**: Reduce latency and API costs\n\n### Advanced RAG Techniques\n\n| Technique | Problem Solved | Example |\n|-----------|----------------|---------|\n| **Hybrid Search** | Pure semantic search misses exact matches | \"GPT-4\" vs \"generative model\" |\n| **Query Expansion** | Single query misses related docs | \"ML bias\" → [\"algorithmic bias\", \"fairness in AI\"] |\n| **Reranking** | Top-K results may not be most relevant | Rerank with cross-encoder |\n| **Compression** | Retrieved docs too long/irrelevant | Extract only relevant sentences |\n\n---\n\n## What We'll Build\n\nBy the end of this notebook, you'll have:\n\n🎯 Hybrid search combining semantic + keyword  \n🎯 Multi-query retrieval system  \n🎯 Reranking pipeline for improved quality  \n🎯 Production-optimized RAG with caching  \n\nLet's dive into advanced RAG! 🚀"

    "Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "There are three main types of machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled data. Examples include classification and regression tasks. Common algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction. Common algorithms include K-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties. This is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.\n",

    "Deep Learning\n",
    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). It has revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.\n",
