    "## Section 3: What Are Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embeddings** are dense numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of embeddings as coordinates in a multi-dimensional space where:\n",
    "- Similar concepts are close together\n",
    "- Different concepts are far apart\n",
    "- The distance between vectors = similarity in meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Embeddings Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional keyword search:**\n",
    "- \"cat\" only matches documents containing \"cat\"\n",
    "- Misses \"feline\", \"kitten\", \"pet\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic search with embeddings:**\n",
    "- \"cat\" finds documents about cats, felines, kittens, pets\n",
    "- Understands meaning, not just exact words\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Famous Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings capture relationships:\n",
    "```\n",
    "King - Man + Woman ≈ Queen\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because embeddings capture semantic relationships in vector space!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are vectors with many dimensions:\n",
    "- **384 dimensions** - Lightweight models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)\n",
    "- **768 dimensions** - Medium models (Google embedding-001)\n",
    "- **1536 dimensions** - Large models (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)\n",
    "- **3072 dimensions** - Extra large (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large)\n",
    "\n",
    "More dimensions = more nuanced representations, but also more storage and computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How LLMs Use Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs work with numbers, not text:\n",
    "1. Text → Embeddings (numbers)\n",
    "2. LLM processes numbers\n",
    "3. Output numbers → Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are the bridge between human language and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's See an Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll generate an embedding for a simple sentence and look at the raw numbers:"

   "source": "### When to Use Each Similarity Metric - Detailed Guide\n\nNow that you know **how** to calculate each metric, let's understand **when** to use each one.\n\n#### 📊 Quick Decision Guide\n\n| Metric | Use When | Common Applications | Don't Use When |\n|--------|----------|---------------------|----------------|\n| **Cosine Similarity** | Direction matters, magnitude doesn't | Text search, RAG, semantic similarity | Vectors need exact magnitude comparison |\n| **Euclidean Distance** | Magnitude matters, absolute distance counts | Clustering, spatial data, image similarity | Comparing different-length vectors |\n| **Dot Product** | Both direction AND magnitude matter | Ranking, scoring, specialized models | General semantic search |\n\n---\n\n#### 🎯 Cosine Similarity - The Default Choice (90%+ of use cases)\n\n**Use for:**\n- ✅ **Text/document similarity** - Finding semantically similar content\n- ✅ **RAG systems** - Retrieving relevant context for LLMs\n- ✅ **Semantic search** - \"Find documents about machine learning\"\n- ✅ **Recommendation engines** - \"Users who liked X also liked Y\"\n- ✅ **Normalized embeddings** - When vectors are already normalized (most embedding models)\n\n**Why it works:**\n- Focuses on **direction** (meaning), not magnitude (length)\n- Range 0-1 is easy to interpret (or -1 to 1 if including opposite meanings)\n- Works consistently across different embedding models\n- Not affected by document length or vector normalization\n\n**Real-world examples:**\n```python\n# Example: Finding similar product descriptions\nquery = \"wireless bluetooth headphones\"\n# Cosine similarity finds:\n# 1. \"noise cancelling wireless earbuds\" (0.89)\n# 2. \"bluetooth audio headset\" (0.85)\n# 3. \"over-ear wireless headphones\" (0.83)\n```\n\n**When NOT to use:**\n- ❌ Vectors represent actual measurements/coordinates (use Euclidean)\n- ❌ Model specifically designed for dot product similarity\n\n---\n\n#### 📏 Euclidean Distance - For Clustering & Spatial Data\n\n**Use for:**\n- ✅ **Clustering algorithms** - K-means, DBSCAN (spatial proximity)\n- ✅ **Image embeddings** - Comparing visual similarity where magnitude matters\n- ✅ **User profiles with features** - Age, income, preferences (actual measurements)\n- ✅ **Anomaly detection** - Finding outliers based on distance\n\n**Why it works:**\n- Measures **straight-line distance** in vector space\n- Considers both direction AND magnitude\n- Natural for spatial/geometric data\n- Works well when all dimensions are comparable/normalized\n\n**Real-world examples:**\n```python\n# Example: Clustering user profiles\nuser1 = [25, 50000, 3.5, 2]  # age, income, avg_rating, purchases\nuser2 = [27, 52000, 3.7, 3]  # Similar user (small Euclidean distance)\nuser3 = [65, 150000, 4.8, 50]  # Different segment (large distance)\n\n# K-means clustering uses Euclidean distance to group similar users\n```\n\n**When NOT to use:**\n- ❌ Text embeddings (direction matters more than length)\n- ❌ Comparing vectors of very different scales (need normalization first)\n- ❌ Semantic similarity tasks\n\n**Key difference from Cosine:**\n```python\nvec_a = [1, 0]\nvec_b = [10, 0]  # Same direction, 10x magnitude\n\n# Cosine: 1.0 (identical direction)\n# Euclidean: 9.0 (far apart due to magnitude)\n```\n\n---\n\n#### ⚡ Dot Product - For Ranking & Specialized Models\n\n**Use for:**\n- ✅ **Ranking models** - When model trained with dot product similarity\n- ✅ **Scoring relevance** - Combining direction and magnitude for ranking\n- ✅ **Certain recommendation systems** - Where magnitude encodes confidence/importance\n- ✅ **Dense retrieval models** - Some models (DPR) use dot product natively\n\n**Why it works:**\n- Combines **both direction and magnitude**\n- Can be faster to compute (no normalization needed)\n- Some neural models optimize for dot product directly\n- Magnitude can encode additional signal (confidence, importance)\n\n**Real-world examples:**\n```python\n# Example: Search ranking where confidence matters\nquery_vec = [0.8, 0.6, 0.9]  # High confidence query\n\ndoc1_vec = [0.9, 0.7, 0.85]  # High confidence, similar direction → High score\ndoc2_vec = [0.1, 0.1, 0.15]  # Low confidence, similar direction → Low score\n\n# Dot product ranks doc1 higher (captures both similarity AND confidence)\n```\n\n**When NOT to use:**\n- ❌ General semantic search (use cosine instead)\n- ❌ When you don't know if model is trained for dot product\n- ❌ Comparing unnormalized vectors from different sources\n\n**Relationship to Cosine:**\n```\nDot Product = Cosine Similarity × ||A|| × ||B||\n\nFor normalized vectors (||A|| = ||B|| = 1):\nDot Product = Cosine Similarity\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 🧪 Practical Comparison Example\n\nLet's see how each metric behaves with the same data:\n```python\n# Same query, same documents, different metrics\n\nquery = \"machine learning tutorial\"\ndoc1 = \"beginner guide to ML algorithms\"\ndoc2 = \"introduction to machine learning\"\ndoc3 = \"advanced deep learning research paper\"\n\n# Results with Cosine Similarity:\n# 1. doc2 (0.89) - Very similar meaning\n# 2. doc1 (0.82) - Related but slightly different focus\n# 3. doc3 (0.65) - Same domain but different level\n\n# Results with Euclidean Distance (smaller = better):\n# 1. doc2 (0.15) - Closest in vector space\n# 2. doc1 (0.22) -\n# 3. doc3 (0.45) - Farthest\n\n# Results with Dot Product:\n# (Depends heavily on vector normalization)\n# If normalized: Similar to cosine\n# If not normalized: Magnitude affects ranking\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 💡 Best Practice Recommendations\n\n**Default choice:** Start with **Cosine Similarity**\n- Works for 90%+ of semantic search use cases\n- Easy to interpret (0-1 range)\n- Robust across different embedding models\n\n**When to reconsider:**\n1. **Use Euclidean** if:\n   - Doing clustering (K-means, hierarchical)\n   - Vectors represent measurements/coordinates\n   - Magnitude has semantic meaning\n\n2. **Use Dot Product** if:\n   - Model documentation specifically recommends it\n   - Doing ranking/scoring tasks\n   - Working with models like DPR, ColBERT\n\n**Testing approach:**\n```python\n# Test all three metrics with your data\nresults_cosine = search_with_cosine(query)\nresults_euclidean = search_with_euclidean(query)\nresults_dot = search_with_dot_product(query)\n\n# Manually review top 10 results from each\n# Choose the metric that gives best quality\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 📚 Summary Cheat Sheet\n\n**For beginners:**\n- Building a chatbot? → **Cosine Similarity**\n- Semantic search? → **Cosine Similarity**\n- RAG system? → **Cosine Similarity**\n- Not sure? → **Cosine Similarity**\n\n**For specific tasks:**\n- Clustering users/documents? → **Euclidean Distance**\n- Image similarity with CNNs? → **Euclidean Distance**\n- Using DPR or specialized ranking model? → **Dot Product**\n\n**When in doubt:**\nTest cosine first. It's the safest default for semantic similarity tasks!",

    "\n",
    "**1. Chunk Size:**\n",
    "- **Sweet spot:** 256-512 tokens (~200-400 words)\n",
    "- Too small: Lost context, too many chunks\n",
    "- Too large: Less precise retrieval, may hit limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Overlap:**\n",
    "- **Recommended:** 10-20% of chunk size\n",
    "- Maintains context continuity between chunks\n",
    "- Prevents important information from being split\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Metadata:**\n",
    "- **Always include:** source, page/location\n",
    "- **Often useful:** date, author, section, category\n",
    "- **For citations:** exact page numbers, URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Testing:**\n",
    "- Test different strategies with your data\n",
    "- Measure retrieval quality\n",
    "- Iterate based on results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic Chunking (Advanced)\n",
    "\n",

    "- Detect topic boundaries\n",
    "- Group related sentences\n",
    "- Create more coherent chunks\n",

    "**Tools:**\n",
    "- LangChain's SemanticChunker\n",
    "- spaCy for sentence detection\n",
    "- Custom models for topic segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- Very long documents\n",
    "- Multiple topics per document\n",
    "- Quality is more important than speed"

    "### What is a Vector Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector database** is a specialized database optimized for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors (embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key difference from traditional databases:**\n",
    "- Traditional DB: Exact match queries (\"WHERE name = 'John'\")\n",
    "- Vector DB: Similarity queries (\"Find documents similar to this query\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional DB vs Vector DB\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Traditional DB | Vector DB |\n",
    "|---------|---------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Storage** | Rows, columns (structured data) | Vectors (embeddings) |\n",
    "| **Query Type** | SQL, exact match | Similarity search |\n",
    "| **Use Case** | CRUD operations, transactions | Semantic search, recommendations |\n",
    "| **Search Method** | Indexes (B-tree, hash) | HNSW, IVF indexes |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Fast exact queries | Fast similarity queries |\n",
    "| **Examples** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB | Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional DB:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < 100 AND category = 'electronics'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector DB:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find products similar to \"wireless headphones with noise cancellation\"\n",
    "results = collection.query(\n",
    "    query_embeddings=[query_embedding],\n",
    "    n_results=10\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popular Vector Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Chroma (We'll use this)**\n",
    "- Open-source, easy to use\n",
    "- Great for learning and prototyping\n",
    "- Local or client-server deployment\n",
    "- Python-first design\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Pinecone**\n",
    "- Managed cloud service\n",
    "- Production-ready, highly scalable\n",
    "- Pay-as-you-go pricing\n",
    "- Excellent documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Weaviate**\n",
    "- Open-source, GraphQL API\n",
    "- Hybrid search (vector + keyword)\n",
    "- Self-hosted or cloud\n",
    "- Multi-tenant support\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. FAISS (Facebook AI)**\n",
    "- Library, not a full database\n",
    "- Extremely fast\n",
    "- Requires more manual setup\n",
    "- Best for researchers/advanced users\n",
    "\n",
    "**Others:** Qdrant, Milvus, Vespa, pgvector (PostgreSQL extension)\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Vector DB vs Traditional DB\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Vector Database when:**\n",
    "- Semantic search is needed\n",
    "- Building RAG applications\n",
    "- Recommendation systems\n",
    "- Similarity-based queries\n",
    "- Content discovery\n",
    "- Duplicate detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Traditional Database when:**\n",
    "- Exact match queries\n",
    "- Transactions (ACID guarantees)\n",
    "- Structured data with relationships\n",
    "- Traditional CRUD operations\n",
    "- Complex joins and aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Both (Hybrid Architecture):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "PostgreSQL (user data, transactions)\n",
    "    +\n",
    "ChromaDB (document embeddings, semantic search)\n",
    "    +\n",
    "Redis (caching)\n",
    "    =\n",
    "Complete production system\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Vector Databases Work (Simplified)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexing:**\n",
    "   - Store vectors with metadata\n",
    "   - Build specialized indexes (HNSW, IVF)\n",
    "   - Optimize for fast similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Querying:**\n",
    "   - Convert query to embedding\n",
    "   - Use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search\n",
    "   - Return top-K most similar vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimization:**\n",
    "   - Quantization (reduce memory)\n",
    "   - Sharding (distribute load)\n",
    "   - Caching (speed up repeated queries)\n",

    "## Section 11: Best Practices & Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Embedding Model Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **DO:**\n",
    "- Use the **same model** for indexing and querying\n",
    "- Start with cost-effective models (OpenAI small, open-source)\n",
    "- Test quality before choosing expensive models\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **DON'T:**\n",
    "- Mix embeddings from different models\n",
    "- Assume larger models are always better\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Chunking Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **DO:**\n",
    "- Use 256-512 token chunks for most use cases\n",
    "- Add 10-20% overlap between chunks\n",
    "- Include rich metadata (source, page, section)\n",
    "- Test different strategies with your data\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **DON'T:**\n",
    "- Use chunks that are too large (>1000 tokens)\n",
    "- Use chunks that are too small (<100 tokens)\n",
    "- Forget to add metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Indexing**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **DO:**\n",
    "- Batch embeddings API calls (cheaper, faster)\n",
    "- Cache embeddings when possible\n",
    "- Update indexes incrementally\n",
    "- Monitor API costs\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **DON'T:**\n",
    "- Generate embeddings one at a time\n",
    "- Regenerate embeddings unnecessarily\n",
    "- Ignore rate limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Search Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **DO:**\n",
    "- Set minimum similarity thresholds (e.g., >0.7)\n",
    "- Combine vector search with metadata filters\n",
    "- Consider hybrid search (vector + keyword)\n",
    "- Use reranking for top results\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **DON'T:**\n",
    "- Return all results regardless of similarity\n",
    "- Rely solely on vector search for everything\n",
    "- Ignore metadata filtering capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **DO:**\n",
    "- Use appropriate vector DB for your scale\n",
    "  - Small: ChromaDB, FAISS\n",
    "  - Large: Pinecone, Weaviate\n",
    "- Monitor query latency\n",
    "- Implement caching for frequent queries\n",
    "- Consider async operations for scale\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **DON'T:**\n",
    "- Use in-memory DB for large datasets\n",
    "- Ignore performance metrics\n",
    "- Block on embedding generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Mixing Embedding Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Problem:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Index with model A\n",
    "embeddings = get_openai_embedding(text)  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Query with model B\n",
    "query_emb = get_google_embedding(query)  # ❌ Different model!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use same model for both\n",
    "embeddings = get_openai_embedding(text)\n",
    "query_emb = get_openai_embedding(query)  # ✅ Same model\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Wrong Chunk Sizes**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Problem:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Too large - loses precision\n",
    "chunks = chunk_by_tokens(text, chunk_size=2000)  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Too small - loses context\n",
    "chunks = chunk_by_tokens(text, chunk_size=50)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Just right - 256-512 tokens\n",
    "chunks = chunk_by_tokens(text, chunk_size=512, overlap=50)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Missing Metadata**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Problem:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# No metadata - can't filter or cite\n",
    "collection.add(documents=docs, embeddings=embs, ids=ids)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Rich metadata for filtering and citations\n",
    "collection.add(\n",
    "    documents=docs,\n",
    "    embeddings=embs,\n",
    "    ids=ids,\n",
    "    metadatas=[{\"source\": \"paper.pdf\", \"page\": 5, \"date\": \"2024-01-15\"}]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. No Text Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Problem:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Raw text with HTML, special characters\n",
    "text = \"<div>Machine learning is...</div> \\n\\n\\n   \"\n",
    "embedding = get_openai_embedding(text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Clean text before embedding\n",
    "import re\n",
    "text = re.sub('<.*?>', '', text)  # Remove HTML\n",
    "text = ' '.join(text.split())  # Normalize whitespace\n",
    "embedding = get_openai_embedding(text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Not Testing Similarity Thresholds**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Problem:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Return all results, even low-quality ones\n",
    "results = collection.query(query_embeddings=[emb], n_results=10)\n",
    "return results  # May include irrelevant documents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Filter by similarity threshold\n",
    "results = collection.query(query_embeddings=[emb], n_results=10)\n",
    "filtered = [\n",
    "    r for r in results \n",
    "    if (1 - r['distance']) > 0.7  # Only high-quality matches\n",
    "]\n",
    "return filtered\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deploying to production:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Same embedding model for index and query\n",
    "- [ ] Optimal chunk size tested (256-512 tokens)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Query: \"budget management strategies\"\n",
    "- Matches: \"financial planning\", \"cost control\", \"expense tracking\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases:**\n",
    "- Document search engines\n",
    "- Knowledge bases\n",
    "- FAQ systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieving relevant context for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- User asks: \"What's our refund policy?\"\n",
    "- Vector DB retrieves relevant policy documents\n",
    "- LLM generates answer using retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases:**\n",
    "- Chatbots with custom knowledge\n",
    "- Q&A systems\n",
    "- Customer support agents\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "- \"Users who liked this article also liked...\"\n",
    "- \"Similar products to what you viewed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases:**\n",
    "- Content recommendations\n",
    "- Product recommendations\n",

    "- Hybrid search (vector + keyword)\n",
    "- Reranking models\n",
    "- Fine-tuning embedding models\n",
    "- Quantization and compression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the next session, try:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build a mini search engine** for your own documents\n",
    "2. **Compare embedding models** - test OpenAI vs Google vs open-source on your data\n",
    "3. **Experiment with chunking** - try different sizes and overlap percentages\n",
    "4. **Add metadata filtering** - categorize documents and filter searches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Common questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Which embedding model should I use?**\n",
    "A: Start with OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (good quality/cost balance). Upgrade if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I know if my chunk size is right?**\n",
    "A: Test retrieval quality with sample queries. If results are too broad, use smaller chunks. If too fragmented, use larger chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Should I use ChromaDB in production?**\n",
    "A: ChromaDB works well for small-medium datasets. For large-scale production, consider Pinecone or Weaviate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How much does this cost?**\n",
    "A: OpenAI embeddings: $0.02 per 1M tokens. For a 10,000 document corpus (~500 tokens each), that's ~$0.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You're Ready for RAG!\n",
    "\n",
    "You now understand the core building blocks:\n",
    "- ✅ How to generate embeddings\n",
    "- ✅ How to measure similarity\n",
    "- ✅ How to chunk documents\n",
    "- ✅ How to store and search vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll put it all together and build a RAG chatbot that can answer questions using your custom knowledge base!\n",
